== General advice ==
Whichever way you want to come here, you should first note down of the ''Raumtelefon''-number so you can call experienced members (''RaumZeitLaboranten'') for advice if lost. Despite our best efforts here, this place is not the easiest to find. 

Once arrived for the very first time at the RaumZeitLabor, it makes sense to call some attention to yourself (introduce yourself). It is a known phenomenon  that members are occasionally too immersed in their activities to notice a new face. How? - Just look for someone who appears to be doing something interesting, someone who seems sympathetic to you or someone who happens to sit right next to you and talk to him/her.
