== General advice ==
Whichever way you're coming here, you should always first note our phone number above so you can call us for advice if lost. Despite our best efforts here, we're not quite easy to find.

Once arrived for the very first time at the RaumZeitLabor, it makes sense to call some attention to yourself (introduce yourself!). It is a known phenomenon that members are occasionally too immersed in their activities to notice a new face. How? - Just look for someone who appears to be doing something interesting, someone who seems sympathetic to you or someone who happens to sit right next to you and talk to him/her.

At http://raumzeitlabor.de/kontakt/anfahrt you will find an [http://raumzeitlabor.de/kontakt/anfahrt interactive map] that will show you the way.
