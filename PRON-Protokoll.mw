RZL1337                          PRON-Wall Protocol                    Juli 2011
================================================================================

 1 Introduction
--------------

This PRON-Wall Protocol (PWP) is defined to make available a datagram mode of
communicating with a series of dot matrix light panels working together to form 
a display. This protocol assumes that the ethernet protocol [1] is used as the
underlying protocol.

This protocol provides a procedure for application programs to send messages 
to light panels with a minimum of protocol mechanism. The protocol is 
transaction oriented.

1.1 Terminology
---------------

panel
      A device connected to the network, with a unique MAC address.
      
subpanel
      A logical unit for displaying pictures. All Subpanels belong to a panel.

display
      The set of panels logically connected to the same Ethernet segment.

client
      The system that sends requests to the display (user equipment).

1.2 Hardware setup
------------------

A display has one ethernet interface (RJ45), power supply and two cinch sockets
to daisy chain the common interrupt line. Displays are addressed by their MAC
address (or via broadcast).

2 Communication
---------------

The following types of frames and packets are used for communication purposes.
The communication is structured into two parts: the first part deals with the
configuration of the panel devices and client software, the second part is used
for the actual image frame transmission and processing. All communication is
based on the Ethernet protocol.

2.1 Ethernet Frame
------------------

              0      8     16    24                          63 
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
              |  T  |  V  |  S  |              R              |
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
	      |                   Payload ...
              +-----+-----+-----+-----...
				
    T ... Packet type
    V ... Version of the protocol (should be 23 for the first version)
    S ... Subpanel ID
    R ... Reserved

    Ethertype: 0x2342

2.2 Packet Types
----------------

The first bit of the packet type defines whether is a request or reply.

    0xxxxxxx ... request message
    1xxxxxxx ... reply message

There are 

    0x00 ... Scan Request
    0x80 ... Scan Reply
    0x01 ... Echo Request
    0x81 ... Echo Reply
    0x02 ... Set Master Request
    0x82 ... Set Master Reply
    0x03 ... Frame
    0x83 ... Frame Acknowledgement

2.2.1 Scan Request Payload
--------------------------

			0		n

			+---+---+---+---+

    R ... Reserved


2.2.2 Scan Reply Payload
------------------------

	0 1           15 16   23 24   31 32    39
	+-+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|T|   BUFSZ     | COLR  |  COLG |  COLB |
	+-+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|      REF      | NSUBP | SUBPR |   X1  |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|  Y1   |   ...
	+-------+...
	
    T      ... Type of display (1 = RGB / 0 = Monochromatic)	
    BUFSZ  ... Buffer size in frames of the panel
    COLR   ... Color of panel (Red value)
    COLG   ... Color of panel (Green value)
    COLB   ... Color of panel (Blue value)
    REF    ... Refresh rate of the panel (Hz)
    NSUBP  ... Number of subpanels in this panel
    SUBPR  ... Subpanels per row
    X(1-N) ... Panel Width in pixels
    Y(1-N) ... Panel Height in pixels

There are as many X,Y pairs as indicated in NSUBP. If NSUBP%SUBPR != 0, the last
row of subpanels consists of less subpanels than the other rows. "Color of
panel" could be used for identification in the client UI.

2.2.3 Echo Request Payload
--------------------------

    0    8   16  24  32
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |       R       |       ID      |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    R  ... Reserved
    ID ... ID of the Echo Request. Should be returned by the other endpoint.


2.2.4 Echo Reply Payload
------------------------

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |       R       |       ID      |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    R  ... Reserved
    ID ... ID of the Echo Request as sent by the client.

2.2.5 Set Master Request Payload
--------------------------------

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |       R       | MAC ADDRESS OF MASTER |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

2.2.6 Set Master Reply Payload
------------------------------

    +---+---+---+---+
    |     R     | I |
    +---+---+---+---+

    R ... Reserved
    I ... Feedback. 1 if the selected Panel is now the Master. 0 if not.

3 Master Autodiscovery
----------------------

Upon bootup, a device waits at least one interrupt interval plus an additional
random backoff timer. If, during that time, no interrupt was recognized on the
input line, the device sets up an interrupt by itself and thus serves as the
master. Also, it informs the connected client about this decision so that
unlikely, but possible collisions (several masters) can be detected and
resolved by the client.

4 Image Frames
--------------

Each frame contains a single image with brightness levels. This image can either
be a greyscale image or one of the three base colors (R,G,B).

The protocol also supports 3D displays. The two most significant bits are 
designated for those frames. The most significant bit marks frames that are part
of a 3D picture, the second one designates a frame for the left eye when it is
not set and for the right eye when set.

4.1 Image Frame
---------------

    0    8   16  24    32
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    | C | TIME  |  SEQ  |
    +---+---+---+---+---+
    |       PIXELS ... 
    ----------...

    C     ... type of frame (see 4.2)
    TIME  ... duration in milliseconds frame will be displayed
    SEQ   ... will be used for retransmissions
    PIXEL ... each pixel is represented by a single byte, containing the
              brightness level of this pixel

4.2 Image Frame Types
---------------------

PWP supports monochromatic/greyscale, 3D and RGB frames. 3D can be achieved
using the shutter technique with an infrared LED serving as the synchronization
clock generator.

    00xxxxxx ... normal frame
    1xxxxxxx ... 3D frame
    10xxxxxx ... 3D frame for left eye
    11xxxxxx ... 3D frame for right eye
    xxxxxx00 ... greyscale frame
    xxxxxx01 ... red frame
    xxxxxx10 ... blue frame
    xxxxxx11 ... green frame

4.3 Sequence number
-------------------

A sequence number designates the current full picture.</code>
