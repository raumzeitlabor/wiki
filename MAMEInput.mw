This is a 32 button input board which connects to your MAME computer and emulates a HID keyboard. It most likely has no key ghosting or blocking, as keys are queried by 4 cascaded shift register. If using 74HCT175, tPD will be 10ns, which means that the shift register delay would be more than acceptable (<1ms to query all keys).

An attiny2313 is used, connected via the usual V-USB setup and the HID firmware.

Parts cost about 8 EUR plus the PCB.
