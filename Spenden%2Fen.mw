[[Spenden|Deutsche Version]]

Coming up soon is the closing of a formal lease for the room which will cause additional running expenses to us. Currently we are unable to cover all expenses through the sale of Food and Drinks or the offering of workshops. Also we are busily renovating and there are maintainance-expenses. In order to cover all these costs we ask for donations. 

That's where you come into play!

We would like to ask you to set up a monthly earmarked donation (''monatliche zweckgebundene Spende'') in favor of the Hackerspace Rhein Neckar.
